 * CR-009 - Reporting model
 *
 * Every statistic is calculated by MySQL using aggregation
 * (COUNT / SUM / MIN / MAX / GROUP BY). No query is executed
 * inside a loop, so the number of queries is fixed
 * (6 for admin, 2 for student) no matter how many courses exist.
 *
 * CR-011 DECISION (pending enrollments):
 * The current schema has no enrollment status column, so every
 * enrollment row is counted. If CR-011 adds a status column,
 * only APPROVED enrollments must be counted in reports. To do that,
 * change COUNTED_ENROLLMENT below to "e.status = 'approved'"
 * (single place - used by every query in this file).
